# Worlds hardest working procrastrinator, starting tomorrow
Hi! Welcome! 
Take a look around

- I like: tinkering, security, public speaking and pretending to know what I'm doing
- Usually I forgot what I was working on and only pick something up months later, so I write README's mostly for myself. (Contributions welcome.)
- My goal is to do most - if not all - edits from a command line, because I like challenges, command lines and dark mode.
- All input is welcome! Please help, I am lost!
- âš¡ Fun fact: 90% of all Koala's have chlamydia
